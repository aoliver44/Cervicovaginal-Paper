# Cervicovaginal-Paper
 
Within this repository you will find the code (and data) needed to generate any figures made in R for the publication: Cervicovaginal microbiome composition drives metabolic profiles in healthy pregnancy (doi: ).

Raw data is accessible by these links:
* 16S_rRNA gene:
* Metagenomic data:
* Metabolomic data: supplemental table 1

Figures not made in R were made in the ecological statistical program called Primer-e (v7).

All code in R was run in the following enviornment:
```
R version 3.4.4 (2018-03-15)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit)
Running under: macOS  10.14.6
```

EXCEPT the R package MuMIn, which requires R v3.5 at the time of this publication.
